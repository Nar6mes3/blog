# My Path to DevOps: Automation, Shell Scripts, and a Little Chaos

Discover how my impatience with manual deployments led me from junior developer to DevOps enthusiast. This is the story of how automating a 24-hour deployment process (with a few crashes along the way) set me on an unexpected path in tech. 🚀💻

## When Impatience Meets Opportunity 🤯

You know those moments where you feel like, "Enough is enough"? Back when I was working as a junior developer, the reality of pushing updates into production felt like...watching paint dry. I was part of a team managing a massive monolith in Java, where deploying updates to dev took (no joke) **24 hours** to see our changes live. So, being young and (let’s face it) a bit impatient, I took matters into my own hands.

### How It All Started 🔧

I couldn’t bear waiting for that deployment cycle. So, I asked for permission to access our development machines, which few developers could use due to the risk of crashing them (which I did...a few times, but more on that later). My goal was simple: get our code updates out there faster.

At the time, there was no connectivity between our CI server (TeamCity) and the deployment servers (development, integration, and production), so "challenge accepted!", I turned this into my first automation project. With zero shell scripting experience, I created a cron job that would check our artifact repository (Nexus) every 20 minutes. If it found new code packages, it would attempt a “hot deployment” (yep, live and without a net!).  

And yes, there were *some* crashes. But hey, at least we could see our updates every 20 minutes instead of every 24 hours!

### Lessons Learned (and a Few System Crashes) ⚠️

Was my setup perfect? Far from it. Testing? Well, that was more of a “live” scenario. After a few successful updates (and some failed ones), the team started taking notice. While it was risky, this setup provided a faster feedback loop that became addictive for all of us.

And you know what? Management noticed too. They encouraged me to refine my process so that the entire team could use it. This marked my move into what I now know as **DevOps**. I went from just coding to thinking about how we deploy, manage, and troubleshoot code in live environments. It was all about taking that extra step to understand the entire development cycle, not just my piece of it.

### From Junior Developer to DevOps Advocate 💼

That first script was the spark that fueled my career shift. Over time, I learned the intricacies of automation, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure management. Gone were the days of manually deploying code into complex environments. Instead, I focused on helping other developers, enhancing automation, and reducing deployment times for everyone. 

Reflecting on that experience, I realize that DevOps is not just about automation, it’s about finding solutions that make everyone’s work easier and our products better.

### Key Takeaways for Aspiring DevOps Engineers ✨

1. **Don’t Wait for Permission**: If you see an opportunity for improvement, go for it. Your initiative might solve a problem that others haven’t tackled yet.
2. **Embrace Trial and Error**: Mistakes will happen, especially in automation. Treat each misstep as a learning experience.
3. **Understand the Big Picture**: DevOps is about the entire development lifecycle. The more you understand it, the more valuable you become to the team.
4. **Stay Curious**: As tech evolves, so should you. My journey from that first cron job to Kubernetes was fueled by curiosity and a passion for improving how we work.

In a nutshell, my impatience led me down a path I didn’t expect, but it taught me resilience, problem-solving, and a whole lot of shell scripting. And today, I'm still exploring ways to make the development process faster, smarter, and a little less painful for everyone involved. 🔍👨‍💻
