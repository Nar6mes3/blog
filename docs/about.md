# About Me

![The future path](assets/landing_page.png)

Hello there! I’m Narcis Mestres 👋, born in beautiful Barcelona and currently based in Germany 🇩🇪. My journey in tech has taken me from early days as a curious coder to a DevOps architect at Red Hat 🎩, specializing in all things CI/CD, Kubernetes, and cloud infrastructure.

## The Early Years: From Barcelona to South America 🌎

I started my life in Spain, but soon after, my family moved to South America, where I spent most of my time in Brazil 🌞. Growing up in such diverse environments gave me a global perspective that I bring to my work every day.

## My Journey in Tech 🚀

I stumbled into tech after a few roles in other fields, and, like most devs, I started with Java 💻. Imagine deploying code on monolithic systems with a *24-hour deployment window*! CI/CD was something of a dream back then. Eventually, I transitioned to full-stack development, working with Java 8 and Spring Boot, breaking monoliths into microservices (because who doesn’t love a good microservice, right? 😅).

## First Steps into DevOps 🌱

Impatience became my superpower when I started automating our deployment processes. My “hello world” scripts weren’t perfect (who remembers learning bash with trial and error? 🙋‍♂️), but they sparked a passion for DevOps and automation that I’ve been running with ever since. Moving into this field opened up a world of possibilities—think faster deployments, smoother processes, and, of course, more coffee ☕️.

## Joining Red Hat 🎩

Today, I’m with Red Hat, where I’m part of a team that’s working to push the boundaries of DevOps, Kubernetes, and cloud infrastructure. There’s nothing quite like the adrenaline of being part of an open-source powerhouse, and I wouldn’t trade it for the world (well… maybe for a lifetime supply of dark chocolate 🍫).

## Lessons Learned 💡

Here are some of the top things I've learned along the way:

- **Automation is Life**: From deployment pipelines to testing, automation is a time-saver and sanity-keeper.
- **Patience & Persistence**: Coding and DevOps often mean hours of troubleshooting. It's part of the journey (and the fun?).
- **Never Stop Learning**: The tech world moves fast, and the best way to stay relevant is to keep learning.

## Tech Stack

Here's a quick rundown of my favorite tools and the ones I've worked with over the years:

#### I Love 💖

- **Languages**: Bash, Asciidoc, Markdown  
- **Frameworks & Methodologies**: Agile, Open Practice Library, Kanban, GitOps, DevSecOps, Platform Engineering  
- **Cloud Tools**: OpenShift, Prometheus, Grafana, Istio, Alert Manager, HashiCorp Vault  
- **CI/CD**: Tekton, ArgoCD  

These are the tools that feel like an extension of my hands, they make life easier, automate the boring stuff, and enable faster, cleaner development workflows.

#### I've Worked With 💻

- **Languages**: Java, JavaScript, React, Python, Bash, Asciidoc, Markdown  
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, React, etc.  
- **DevOps Tools**: Kubernetes, OpenShift, Tekton, ArgoCD  
- **CI/CD**: TeamCity, Jenkins, GitLab Pipelines, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Tekton, ArgoCD, Urban Code Deploy  

These are the ones that have been part of my toolkit in various projects, from massive monoliths to microservice architectures. Working with these tools taught me resilience, debugging, and even the value of “patchwork solutions” when resources are tight!

## Core Values & Goals 🎯

At the heart of everything I do are the values I live by: Honesty, Courage, Family, and Helping Others. Here’s how these translate into my work and this blog:

- **Continuous Learning**: I’m always on the hunt to learn something new, whether that’s diving into AI, exploring MLOps, or mastering Kubernetes. Growth mindset, 100%. 
- **Problem-Solving**: There’s nothing like the thrill of solving a tough bug or troubleshooting a complex pipeline. With every challenge, I’m sharpening my skills and finding new ways to automate the pain points. 
- **Collaboration**: The best products come from great teams. I genuinely enjoy working with others and sharing knowledge; it’s what makes this field exciting and rewarding.

In "404 Thoughts," I’ll be sharing my experiences, insights, and maybe a few “what NOT to do” moments from my DevOps journey. My goal is to create a space where seasoned professionals and newcomers alike can find tips, inspiration, and the occasional laugh. Hope you enjoy the ride!
